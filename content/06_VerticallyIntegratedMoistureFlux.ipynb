    "The essence of the overall hydrological cycle is the evaporation of moisture ($E$) in one place and the precipitation in other places ($P$). In particular, evaporation exceeds precipitation over the oceans, which allows moisture to be transported by the atmosphere onto land where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, and the runoff flows into streams and rivers and discharges into the ocean, completing the cycle (Trenberth et al., 2011).\n"

    "Areas for which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation ($E âˆ’ P > 0$) are moisture source regions over which the atmospheric moisture fluxes diverge (divergence term >0), and other areas, where moisture fluxes converge, are moisture sink regions.\n",

    "The local change of the total column water vapor is therefore dependent on the local precipitation, evaporation and the moisture flux which transports moisture from neigbouring columns into the respective column."
