    "This chapter is all about plotting wind data. Since wind is - as opposed to e.g. the scalar field of temperature - a vector field, there are also some special tools for plotting winddata, that differ from the ones we saw in the precious chapter. In this chapter, we will first deal with 10m winds in x- and y-direction and second we will have a look at 4D-data: wind at different heights!\n",
